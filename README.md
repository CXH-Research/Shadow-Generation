# Shadow-Generation

Methods to generate shadows in images.

Including two approaches: composition and generation.

Composition method basically pastes the shadow mask to image directly and alter the alpha parameter to adjust the transparency of shadow.

Generation is based on [GitHub - google/portrait-shadow-manipulation](https://github.com/google/portrait-shadow-manipulation).
